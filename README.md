# Weather-App-Vue

Created a simple frontend Vue application that allows a user to check the current weather. This app fetches info from official Open Weather Map API

• The user can consult the updated app in real time, since the app indicates the temperature, the date and the location resulting from the search. It also provides indication such as whether it is sunny or if there are clouds

• Used of the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful API to return the current weather data

• Will create a Heroku post build script
